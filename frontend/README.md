### Activating and Running the React App

#### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

#### Steps to Activate and Run the React App

1. **Navigate to Your Project Directory:**
   Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your React project is located.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   If you haven't installed dependencies yet, run the following command to install necessary packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This command installs all dependencies listed in `package.json`.

3. **Start the Development Server:**
   To run the React app locally, use:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This command starts a development server and opens your default web browser to preview the app. By default, the app runs on `http://localhost:3000`.

4. **Accessing the React App:**
   Once the development server starts, you can access your React app by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

5. **Stopping the Development Server:**
   To stop the development server, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal or command prompt where it's running.
