I have mentioned how to run backend and frontend inside the backend README.md and frontend README.md

Approach:
The provided code implements a Flask backend and React frontend for uploading audio or video files, converting them to text using speech recognition, summarizing the text using a Hugging Face model, and displaying the original text and summary in the frontend. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

### Flask Backend (`app.py`):

1. **Setup and Dependencies**:
   - Imports necessary libraries including Flask, Flask-CORS, speech_recognition, requests, Werkzeug, moviepy, logging, and pydub.
   - Configures Flask app and enables CORS.

2. **Utility Functions**:
   - `extract_audio_from_video(video_path)`: Extracts audio from a video file and saves it as `audio.wav`.
   - `convert_audio_to_text(file_path)`: Converts audio file to text using Google Speech Recognition.
   - `summarize_text(text)`: Sends text to a Hugging Face API (`facebook/bart-large-cnn`) for summarization.

3. **Routes**:
   - `/`: Default route returning a welcome message.
   - `/upload` (POST): Accepts file uploads, validates file type (audio/video), saves the file, extracts text (if audio), summarizes text, and returns JSON response with original text and summary.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Logs errors appropriately for audio extraction, text conversion, API requests, and unexpected errors.

5. **Run the App**:
   - Creates an `uploads` directory if not existent.
   - Runs the Flask app in debug mode.

### React Frontend (`App.js` and `FileUpload.js`):

1. **Components and State Management**:
   - `App.js`: Main component managing file upload, form submission, and displaying results (original text and summary).
   - `FileUpload.js`: Component specifically handling file upload UI and displaying uploaded file's original text and summary.

2. **Event Handlers**:
   - `handleFileChange`: Updates state with selected file.
   - `handleSubmit`: Sends file to Flask backend (`/upload` endpoint) using Axios, displays loading spinner during upload, and updates state with returned text and summary.

3. **Styling and UI**:
   - Material-UI components for structured UI layout.
   - Displays file upload button, original text, summary, and error messages.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Displays error messages if file upload fails.

### Summary:

This setup allows users to upload audio or video files, have them converted to text, summarized using a pretrained model, and view the results in a React-based frontend. Error handling ensures robustness, logging captures potential issues, and CORS enables cross-origin requests from the frontend to the Flask backend.
